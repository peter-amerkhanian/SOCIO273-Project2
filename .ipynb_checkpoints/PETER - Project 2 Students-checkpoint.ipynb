This is important because when we do feature selection, we want to make sure that the features we use are in some way associated with or else influence the outcome. We can see that various demographic characteristics are associated - negatively or positively - with the Diabetes rate, and including them will likely make our model more robust."

    "### 6.1 What is bias-variance tradeoff? Why is it relevant to machine learning problems like this one?\n",
    "- The variance refers to the amount by which the predicted parameters would change if we estimate it using a different training set, whereas the bias refers to the difference between the predicted and real outcomes. The bias-variance tradeoff means that in most of models, the variance will increase while the bias decrease, and vice versa.\n",
    "- Bias-variance tradeoff exists in most, if not all, machine learning problems because data scientists strive to create accurate (low bias) and generalizable (low variance) models. Specifically, when using machine learning methods to inform public policy, policymakers might also place emphasis on drawing fair and transparent conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Define overfitting, and why it matters for machine learning. How can we address it?\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model has high variance and thus is most likely ungeneralizable and has high bias when applied to unseen data. We can address overfitting using cross-validation. Through iteratively creating multiple train-test split datasets, cross-validation allows for tuning hyperparameters and identifying a model with the optimal bias-variance tradeoff.\n",

    "We would suggest to prioritize the 10 locations above for the pilot program because they have the highest predicted number of diabetes in our model. With regards to considering race, gender, or age composition, we can see that these geographies are almost all majority white, and we would alter this choice in order to better center racial equity. The counties do not seem as lopsided in terms of gender or age, though we could conduct further statistical analysis of these target counties to be more sure. We would be somewhat conservative to deploy this model in a real-world application because the R_square of the chosen model (~0.41) is not large enough, which suggests that there might be important missing features that could well explain diabetes numbers."
